### Challenge 2 - Palindrome Checker

#### Task:
Given a string (which can contain white space and punctuation characters, but these should be ignored), write a function to check if that string is a palindrome.

#### Example:
`A car, a man, a maraca` would return true.
`Adam is the best` would return false.
`A but tuba` would return true.
`I can say but tuba with a straight face` would return false.

#### Extension:
If you found this easy, try it again but without using any string manipulation functions.
